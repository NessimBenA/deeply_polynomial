# Deep Polynomial Neural Networks and XOR Problem

This repository contains the code used in the Medium article titled "Deep Polynomial Neural Networks and Why You Should Care About Them." The code demonstrates how to use deep polynomial neural networks to solve the XOR problem.

## Installation

Install the required package, `pytorch-lightning`, by running the following command:

```bash
!pip install pytorch-lightning
```

## Usage

The code provided includes the following sections:

1. Plotting the XOR function
2. Training a single-layer perceptron (SLP) on the XOR dataset
3. Training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on the XOR dataset
4. Training a MLP with ReLU activation on the XOR dataset
5. Training a Multiplicative-Additive Perceptron (MAP) on the XOR dataset

To use the code, simply copy the entire code block into a Google Colab notebook and execute it. The code will train different neural network architectures on the XOR dataset, and it will visualize the decision boundaries of each model to help understand their capabilities and limitations.
